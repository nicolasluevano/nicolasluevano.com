## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 


## Lessons Learned:

This was a great project for me mainily because I really got into the nitty gritty of API's. Trying to get a Spotify API token generated withouth a server took me a while to figure out, but I found another API (last.fm) that was able to give me the song information needed without the need of OAuth
